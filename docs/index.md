# Introduction {-}

The purpose of this book is to collect recommended programming patterns for R
programmers. This book is curated by the greater R community with documented
code examples from currently available packages. This book is intended to be a
reference for R package authors. If you're looking to get started writing R
packages we recommend you start with reading 
[R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham or 
[Mastering Software Development in R](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/RProgDA/) 
by Roger Peng, Sean Kross, and Brooke Anderson.
