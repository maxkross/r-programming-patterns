This book is curated by the greater R community with documented code examples from currently available packages. This book is intended to be a reference for R package authors. If you’re looking to get started writing R packages we recommend you start with reading R Packages by Hadley Wickham or Mastering Software Development in R by Roger Peng, Sean Kross, and Brooke Anderson.

For easy access to these files it’s a good idea to include a function like mypackage_example() which returns the path to an example file. You can find sample code for this function below: #&#39; Get path to mypackage example #&#39; #&#39; mypackage comes bundled with some example files in its `inst/extdata` #&#39; directory. This function make them easy to access. #&#39; #&#39; @param path Name of file. If `NULL`, the example files will be listed. #&#39; @export #&#39; @examples #&#39; mypackage_example() #&#39; mypackage_example(&quot;data.csv&quot;) mypackage_example &lt;- function(path = NULL) { if (is.null(path)) { dir(system.file(&quot;extdata&quot;, package = &quot;mypackage&quot;)) } else { system.file(&quot;extdata&quot;, path, package = &quot;mypackage&quot;, mustWork = TRUE) } } 1.1.1 Real World Examples readxl "]
